{-| A collection of methods applied to a specific source.

The methods are as follows:

  - `defaultDetails`: Get the default placeholder details for the specific source, until the real details are loaded.
  - `tooltip`: A tooltip to display on hover for the specific source, if one makes sense.
  - `general`: The general methods for sources of this type.

-}
type alias Methods msg =
    IsSpecific (GeneralMethods msg) msg


{-| A collection of methods applied to a specific external source.

The methods are as follows:

  - `rest`: Get the methods not specific to external sources.
  - `general`: The general methods for sources of this type.
  - `editor`: An editor for the source to allow the user to create/edit a reference to one.
  - `equals`: Test if two sources are the same (and should therefore be deduplicated, for example).
  - `problems`: Any problems with the given specific source. If this returns any problems, then the source is considered invalid.

{-| A collection of methods that apply generally to any source of the given type.

The methods are as follows:

  - `name`: A general name for the source.
  - `logo`: A logo for the source, if there is one.

-}

    { name : () -> MdString
    , logo : () -> Maybe (Html msg)

{-| A collection of methods that apply generally to any external source of the given type.

The methods are as follows:

  - `rest`: Get the general methods not specific to external sources.
  - `empty`: A source with no value (doesn't have to validate) that can be used as an initial value for the editor.
